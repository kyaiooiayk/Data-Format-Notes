## YAML
It is a human-readable data-serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted. Both JSON and YAML are developed to provide a human-readable data interchange format. The YAML is realized as a superset of JSON format. It means that we can parse JSON using a YAML parser. Although the practical implementation of this theory is little tricky. Be aware thath YAML is an extremely bad choice for any configuration file because it's wildly unpredictable.
